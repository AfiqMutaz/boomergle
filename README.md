## Practice Search Engine
###### Boomergle is an emulation of a search engine, created entirely with PHP

Boomergle was designed for my Web Programming PHP Module. I was intructed to use create a simple system with PHP which completely utilizes arrays
and what better way to iterate arrays than to use a search engine as an example.

Search engines are not this easy to make, that is why I labeled it only as an emulation or an example of how it could've been done but simpler. 
I am still a student, there is definitely a better way of doing this as my method deteriorates performance.
